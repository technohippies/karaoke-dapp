- **Spaced Repetition System (SRS)**: Learn lyrics efficiently with FSRS algorithm
- **Encrypted Content**: Songs and translations secured with Lit Protocol
- **Web3 Authentication**: Social login via Web3Auth
- **Voice & Song Credits**: Token-based access system

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Smart Contracts

**KaraokeSchool** (`0x047eCeBC1C289b26210CDdc6a0BB343a2C984F5d`)
- Manages voice and song credits
- Handles song unlocking mechanism
- Escrows credits during karaoke sessions
- Verifies PKP signatures for scoring

### Lit Protocol Integration

- **Content Encryption**: Songs, MIDI files, and translations are encrypted using Lit Protocol
- **Access Control**: Only users who have unlocked songs can decrypt content
- **PKP Scoring**: Secure, tamper-proof scoring using Programmable Key Pairs
- **Lit Actions**: 
  - Karaoke Scorer: Contains embedded API keys for Deepgram (STT) and OpenRouter (LLM)
  - Single Line Scorer: For Study Mode pronunciation practice
  
**Note**: Lit Actions use simple access conditions (always true) for API key decryption, making them independent of contract changes.

### Database

- **IndexedDB**: Local storage for offline functionality
- **Tableland**: Decentralized SQL database for song metadata
- **IPFS (Pinata)**: Encrypted content storage

## üéÆ User Flow

1. **Connect Wallet**: Web3Auth social login or wallet connection
2. **Purchase Credits**: Buy song and voice credits with USDC
3. **Browse Songs**: View available songs in the catalog
4. **Unlock Songs**: Spend song credits to access content
5. **Study Mode**: Practice individual lines with SRS
6. **Karaoke Mode**: Full song performance with AI scoring
7. **Review Progress**: Track learning statistics and streaks

## üîí Security Considerations

- **No API Keys in Code**: All sensitive keys must be in `.env` files
- **Encrypted Storage**: All content is encrypted before IPFS upload
- **Access Control**: Smart contract verification for content access
- **PKP Verification**: Tamper-proof scoring through Lit Protocol

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run contract tests
cd contracts
forge test

# Run frontend tests
cd apps/web
bun test
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build frontend
cd apps/web
bun run build

# Deploy contracts
cd contracts
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url $BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast

# After deployment, update references:
# 1. Update contract address in apps/web/src/constants/contracts.ts
# 2. Update .env (KARAOKE_CONTRACT and VITE_KARAOKE_CONTRACT)
# 3. Extract and update ABI:
cat out/KaraokeSchool.sol/KaraokeSchool.json | python3 -c "import json, sys; print(json.dumps(json.load(sys.stdin)['abi'], indent=2))" > ../apps/web/src/constants/abi/KaraokeSchool.json

# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: See CONTRACT_UPDATE_GUIDE.md for full update process including Lit Protocol considerations
```

### Adding New Songs

1. Add MIDI and translation files to `data/raw/`
2. Update `data/metadata.json`
3. Run encryption script: `cd scripts && bun prepare-song.ts --id [songId]`
4. Deploy to Tableland: `cd tableland && bun add-song.ts`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- This is a testnet application - use only test tokens
- Never commit `.env` files or API keys
- Always encrypt sensitive content before storage
- Test thoroughly on testnet before mainnet deployment

## üìö Repository Access

This project is available on multiple platforms for redundancy and censorship resistance:

### Primary Repository
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/technohippies/karaoke-dapp.git

### Decentralized Mirror
- **Radicle**: https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/rosa.radicle.xyz/rad:zjAPSYMsctUsESkgc9XqTgcstWUH
- **Clone via Radicle**: `rad:zjAPSYMsctUsESkgc9XqTgcstWUH`

The Radicle repository serves as a decentralized, censorship-resistant mirror. Updates are automatically synchronized from GitHub with a slight delay. If the repository is removed from centralized platforms for any reason, or if you're in a region with restricted access, the complete codebase will remain permanently accessible through Radicle's peer-to-peer network.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Notice & Copyright Compliance

### Content Licensing
This platform operates in full compliance with copyright law and digital rights management:

- **Lyrics Content**: All copyrighted lyrics are dynamically loaded from LRCLIB's API. We do not host, store, or distribute any copyrighted lyrical content on our servers or in this repository.

- **Musical Compositions**: No copyrighted audio recordings or musical compositions are hosted on our infrastructure. The platform utilizes MIDI files which represent musical notation data only, not recorded performances.

- **Digital Rights Management**: Encrypted MIDI files are made available for download (not streaming) exclusively after an on-chain purchase transaction is completed. This ensures proper licensing and royalty tracking.

- **Royalty Compliance**: All transactions are recorded on-chain with complete transparency. Royalties are automatically calculated and reserved for rights holders in accordance with Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) requirements and applicable copyright law.

- **Rights Holder Payments**: Smart contracts ensure that appropriate royalties are segregated and made available to verified rights holders through transparent on-chain mechanisms.

### Disclaimer
