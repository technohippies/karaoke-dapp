# Song Re-Encryption Summary

## What Was Done

1. **Updated Environment Variables**
   - Added `KARAOKE_PROXY=0x9908f93A794297093fA0d235B51Ffbd86FDe8d08` to:
     - `/media/t42/th42/Code/lit-test/.env` (root environment file)
     - `/media/t42/th42/Code/lit-test/scripts/.env` (scripts environment file)
   - Also added `PINATA_JWT` to the root `.env` file since the prepare-song script loads from there

2. **Re-encrypted All Songs**
   - Successfully re-encrypted 2 songs (Royals by Lorde and Dancing Queen by ABBA)
   - All songs now use the proxy contract address for encryption conditions
   - New IPFS CIDs generated:
     - Song 1 (Royals): 
       - MIDI CID: `QmNxF6X7WKMF9Rc1fsAjpr3abK38WZnCkKwiibUZjqGqFS`
       - Translations CID: `QmaPPaLc8PfuJZ8WgNp3suwLuAjeyj4cGuosLQ8VMTgPjX`
     - Song 2 (Dancing Queen):
       - MIDI CID: `QmW2GRiMVonwBNjNHqxebTEfrdBwRC2bXS2hAHPYRunckV`
       - Translations CID: `QmQLWYxaWCia23TbK1JLPbpPfbRNtYY4CUGYmPEyowQJSK`

## Next Steps

1. **Update Tableland**
   - Run the Tableland update script to update the song records with the new IPFS CIDs:
   ```bash
   cd scripts && npx tsx update-tableland-v2.ts
   ```

2. **Clear Web App Cache**
   - Clear browser cache/local storage to ensure fresh data is loaded
   - Or restart the web app development server

3. **Test Decryption**
   - Test that the web app can successfully decrypt songs using the proxy contract
   - Verify that users who have unlocked songs can still access them

## Important Notes

- The proxy address (`0x9908f93A794297093fA0d235B51Ffbd86FDe8d08`) is now set in all relevant environment files
- The web app's `.env.local` already has the correct proxy address
- All future song encryptions will automatically use the proxy address
- The encryption uses the `hasUnlockedSong` function on the proxy contract as the access control condition

## Configuration Files Updated

1. `/media/t42/th42/Code/lit-test/.env` - Added KARAOKE_PROXY and PINATA_JWT
2. `/media/t42/th42/Code/lit-test/scripts/.env` - Added KARAOKE_PROXY
3. Songs re-encrypted and saved to `/media/t42/th42/Code/lit-test/data/encrypted/`
