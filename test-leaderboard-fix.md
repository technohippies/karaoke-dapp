# Leaderboard Mobile Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Mobile Overflow and Scroll Issues
- **Problem**: The leaderboard image was causing horizontal scroll on mobile and appearing behind the footer
- **Solution**: 
  - Reduced minimum height from `min-h-[400px]` to `min-h-[300px]` on mobile (with `sm:min-h-[400px]` for larger screens)
  - Added responsive image sizing: `w-40 sm:w-48 md:w-56` (smaller on mobile)
  - Added `maxHeight: '200px'` inline style to prevent the image from being too tall
  - Removed `overflow-x-hidden` from the container which could cause issues

### 2. Layout Improvements
- Changed from `justify-end` to `justify-center` for better vertical centering
- Added `relative` positioning to ensure proper z-index stacking
- Added `z-10` to the speech bubble for better layering
- Wrapped the image in a flex container for better centering

### 3. Image Responsiveness
- Previous image classes: `w-48 sm:w-56 md:w-64`
- New image classes: `w-40 sm:w-48 md:w-56` (smaller overall)
- Added `style={{ maxHeight: '200px' }}` to prevent vertical overflow

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test on various mobile devices (iPhone, Android)
2. Check both portrait and landscape orientations
3. Verify the leaderboard tab doesn't cause scrolling issues
4. Ensure the image doesn't overlap with the fixed footer
5. Test with different viewport heights

## Code Changes

### `/apps/web/src/components/Leaderboard.tsx`
- Adjusted the empty state container styling for better mobile responsiveness
- Made the image smaller and added max-height constraint
- Improved layout structure for better centering

### `/apps/web/src/pages/SongPage.tsx`
- Removed `overflow-x-hidden` from the leaderboard container
- The page already has proper padding-bottom (`pb-24`) to account for the fixed footer
